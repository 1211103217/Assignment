# Alien vs. Zombie

This code is an implementation of a basic game in which aliens fight against zombies. The game is played on a grid of characters and the user can specify the size of the grid by changing the number of rows and columns. The number of zombies in the game can also be specified by the user.

The game begins with a greeting message and a prompt for the user to change the default settings, which are the number of rows, columns, and zombies. If the user decides to change the default settings, they are prompted to enter the desired number of rows, columns, and zombies.

After setting the size of the grid and the number of zombies, the game populates the grid with aliens, zombies, health, rocks, and pods. These elements are randomly placed on the grid. Aliens are placed in the center of the grid, zombies are randomly placed on the grid, and the other elements are also randomly placed on the grid. The number of health, rocks, and pods are determined by generating random numbers within a specified range.

Finally, the grid is displayed to the user. The grid is a two-dimensional vector of characters, and the display shows the character of each cell in the grid. The first row of the display shows the column numbers and each subsequent row shows the contents of a row of the grid.

In summary, this code implements a basic game in which aliens fight against zombies on a grid, and the grid is randomly populated with aliens, zombies, health, rocks, and pods.
